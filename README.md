# Running

Make sure to install `pygame` using `pip` in order to be able to run all games properly:

```
pip install pygame
```

Then, you can open the launcher by running:

```
python launcher/src/main.py
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> I do not claim ownership of every single game in here, I only collaborated in the creation of the launcher and the fifth game. This is just an archive for preservation purposes.
